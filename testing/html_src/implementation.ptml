                Our Testing Implementation
            </h1>
            
            <h4>Installation</h4>
            <p> We have decided to move forward with Jenkins for our CI pipeline.
            For this we need to host Jenkins on an AWS EC2 instance 
            and then connect it to the DevOps Github Repository </p>
            <h4>Installing Jenkins on AWS</h4>
                <ul class="nested">
                  <li>
                      <b> Step 1: Creating an AWS EC2 instance</b> 
                      </br>
                        Create an EC2 instance on the AWS 
                        account. Use a free tier eligible, 
                        Ubuntu server that comes with 
                        pre-installed Python 3.6<br> 
                        One thing to keep 
                        in mind is while associating security 
                        group to this EC2 instance
                        make sure the port 8080 is open to the world and 
                        download the secret key. 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      <b> Step 2: SSH into the AWS machine</b> </br>
                      Next step is to SSH into the AWS machine using the 
                      credentials downloaded in the previous step.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      <b> Step 3: Installing Jenkins</b> </br>
                      Follow the steps in the link to install jenkins <a href="https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Installing+Jenkins+on+Ubuntu" > Install Jenkins </a><br>
                      To start the Jenkins service : "sudo service jenkins start"
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      <b> Step 4: Initial Jenkins setup </b> </br>
                      After following the previous steps, you need to go 
                      the url which is your public dns of your EC2 
                      instance:8080(E.g. http://ec2-aws.compute:8080) 
                      You should be able to see the jenkins server up 
                      and running.
                  </li>
                </ul>

            <h4>Here's a way of triggering a Jenkins 
            build from a push to Github.</h4>
                <p> A reason to choose Jenkins was the 
                availability of many plugins.
                One such plugin is the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/GitHub+Integration+Plugin">Github Integration Plugin</a>
               </p>

                <ul class="nested">
                    <li>
                    <b>Step 1: Install the Github Integration Plugin</b><br>
                    On the "Manage Jenkins" page, you will find
                    "Manage Plugins."
                    Then click on the "Available" tab.
                    After checking the GitHub plugin,
                    click on 'Download Now'.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                    <b> Step 2: Prepare Github Repository</b><br>
                    We now need to add service to call Jenkins Github 
                    webhook on a push.
                    Inside the github repo, go to Settings - Integrations 
                    &and; Services - Add service <br>
                    Select Jenkins(Github Integration) from 
                    drop-down menu.
                    In the new window, enter 
                    "Jenkins Hook URL+ "/github-webhook/"
                    e.g. http://ci.jenkins-ci.org/github-webhook/ <br>
                    Click on "test service"
                    (NOTE: Services are being deprecated: new documentation
                    soon on how to use webhook!)
                    </li>

                    <li>
                    <b>Step 3: Give repo access to Jenkins 
                    User</b><br>
                    This is a very important step. There are 
                    several ways to do so.<br>
                    1. use github OAuth plugin. <br>
                    2. Store plain-text user/password combo on Github
                    <br>
                    To be further discussed..
                    </li>
                </ul>
               <!-- add webhook related steps -->
               <!-- add slack integration steps and video link -->
            <h4>Slack integration with Jenkins</h4>
            <p> Slack is a tool used by companies on the whole 
            and inside teams for work related communication, 
            file sharing, notifications etc. It is important to 
            get notified if tests fail on Jenkins hence we have 
            integrated it with Slack to be well-informed.</p>
            <ul class="nested">
            <li> <b>Step 1:</b> On Jenkins page, go to Manage Plugins, 
            click on Available tab to show all available plugins.
            </li>
            <li> <b>Step 2:</b> In the search bar, type 'Slack'. You will 
            see all Slack related plugins. Select the 'Slack Notifier Plugin'.
            </li>
            <li> <b>Step 3:</b> Now click on 'Install without restart'. 
            You should see 'success' written. Now you have the plugin 
            successfully installed and ready to be configured.
            </li>
            <li> <b>Step 4: </b>click on Manage Plugins -- select Configure 
            System -- 
            scroll to the bottom of page to see section 'Global 
            Slack Notifier Settings'. You will see that it requires 
            a few important details to be filled in. <b>We will get 
            these details from Slack.</b>
            </li>
            <li> <b>Step 5: Add integration in Slack </b><br>
            First create new channel for getting Jenkins notifications. Now
            Go to Settings - Add an app or integration - Search for Jenkins.
            Click on add configurations button on the Jenkins CI page and 
            give it rights for your newly created channel e.g. testing
            This will add your integration on Slack.
            </li>
            <li> <b>Step 6: Generate integration token in Slack </b><br>
            On sucessful integration, Slack shows a page with instructions.
            Scroll till Step 3 of these instructions. You will see the 
            'team domain' and the 'integration token' have been provided.
            Copy team domain value and paste it in the Jenkins page for team 
            subdomain.
            </li>
            <li> <b>Step 7: Create Token Credential in Jenkins</b><br>
            Jenkins asks us to create a Token credential and not paste the 
            token directly for security reasons.
            Click on add credentials - choose Jenkins - in the pop-up box, 
            set 'Kind' as 'Secret Text'
            Paste the integration token in the textbox next to label 'Secret'.
            give an appropriate id e.g. Jenkins-integration-token 
            and a description 
            before you click Add.
            Now you can pick the recently created token from the drop-down.

            </li>
            <li> <b>Step 8: Specify channel to post notifications </b><br>
            Finally, type the channel name e.g. testing , in the last box.
            This is the channel that will get all notifications.
            Click on 'Test Connection', it shall result in success written 
            so you can save this configuration by clicking on save 
            button at the bottom.
            </li>

            <li> <b>Step 9: Set Post-build actions in Jenkins </b><br>
            Open the project - Click on configue (left sidebar).
            Scroll to the bottom till you find 'Post-build Actions' section.
            On clicking the button, select Slack notification. You can now 
            select when you want to get notified 
            e.g. when build starts/when build fails/ when it passes, etc.
            Save these settings.
            </li>
            <li> <b>Step 10: Trigger Build to test </b><br>
            Now that the configuration is ready and integration is completed
            you can trigger a build manually to check the notification on 
            specified Slack channel. To do this select 'Build Now' 
            from left side menu.
            Now open Slack and see the notification messages from Jenkins.
            Yay!
